# Slid3
**Slid3** is an Android Game which is based on the famous 15-Slide Puzzle where you need to slide and arrange the number-tiles (numbered from 1-15) in order. This game has been created with **Unity Editor**. This is the first game I made with Unity Editor, and I no longer maintain this game as I am working on other stuff.

# Suggestions
- Extend this game for 5x5 and 6x6 boards.
- Allow playing with picture-tiles as well by partitioning a picture into several tiles.
- Allow tiles to push each other so that multiple tiles can be moved in a single turn. 
- Add more backgrounds to game and choose a random background every time, or maybe allow the user to choose one.
- Add a "Total Time Played" info to stats page.
